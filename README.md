I find it interesting to work on open source.
It has usage in all domains like Data Science and has extended beyond the boundaries of software too.
It encourages Ideation, Innovation and promotes transparency.Collaboration helps in giving back to the community.Linux and python have enhanced due to open source contributions.
And last but not the least it helps us to grow and innovate:)

 Looking forward to join the IITG open source Community !!
